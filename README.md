These are my solutions for University of Helsinky programming course in Python 2024. They are not seperated into 2 parts like the course itself since it's just a dump to have it at hand. I skipped the pygame stuff since I wanted to start doing my own stuff ASAP. If some of the solutions don't make sense it's probably because I was bad and learning but they all work and passed the tests so they should be good.
